<u><h2>Lenovo's IdeaPad Miix 700 Strategy Top Notch</h2></u></div>

<img class=pictureone src=lenovosurface2.jpg alt="Lenovo's IdeaPad Miix 700" style="width:423px;height:250px;">
<div style="font-size:15px" align=left class=para><p>When Microsoft introduced the Surface, it caused a great amount of confusion in the industry, and consternation among its partners. After all,
Microsoft relies almost entirely on the strength of its hardware OEM partners, 
both for the direct revenue generated by Windows and for subsequent Office revenue.Nearly four years, and several versions of Surface products, later, Microsofts strategy has reaped some 
dramatic rewards. My experience with Lenovos new IdeaPad Miix 700 is a great example 
of the initiatives success. Its possible that the Miix 700 would never have happened without the example, and competitive push,
that the Surface family provided. Of course, Microsoft wins either way, whether the Surface products themselves sell, or they promote the creation 
of innovative new Windows-based devices that create royalty and application software revenue for them. 
<h3>Lenovos Best Bits</h3>
<p>The Miix 700 mimics the formerly unique keyboard cover and adjustable kickstand features of the Surface lineup. The Miix keyboard even includes a magnet so it can be used slanted slightly upwards like the Surface.
I actually like typing on the Miix better than on the Microsoft Type cover for the SP3, 
although the upgraded version Microsoft has released for the SP3 and SP4 matches typing on the Miix.</p>
<h3>Comparison With Surface Pro 3</h3>
<p>Compared to the SP3, It features an updated CPU (it uses chips from Intel's new Core M "Skylake"family), and a similar screen (12-inch 2160 x 1440). Both the Miix and the SP3 can be purchased with either 4GB or 8GB 
or RAM. The SP3 can be purchased with an SSD as large as 512GB, while the max on the Miix is 256GB. Both also feature enterprise-requested TPM chips. Both the SP3 and Miix 700 weigh about 1.7 pounds without the keyboard. 
In my experience, the Miix has better battery life (both when running and when sleeping) than my SP3 â€” although in fairness my SP3 battery is over a year old.</p></div>

<u><h2>Computer Usage Falls By 20% </h2></u></div>
<img class=pictureone src=computerusage2.jpg alt="computer usage" style="width:423px;height:250px;">


<div style="font-size:15px" align=left class=para><p>A decade ago, almost all web browsing was happening on desktop and laptop computers. The explosion in smartphone popularity has rapidly changed the dynamic, and older predictions may have underestimated the impact. 
According to new report from comScore, computer use is dropping off quickly as mobile devices encourage new types of interaction. In fact, many younger people don't use computers at all, instead relying entirely upon their smartphones</
<h3>The DownFall</h3>
<p>The conventional wisdom a few years ago was that desktop usage (desktop meaning both desktop and laptop PCs) would level off or grow at a slower rate in the face of mobile device adoption. However, the trends aren't following that model. The data gathered by
comScore points to substantial year-over-year drops in desktop usage. In December 2015, desktop Internet use was down 9.5% compared with the previous year. In January 2016 it was down 7.6%. February and March of this year were better at 2% and 6% down, but the trend looks to be continuing.</p>

<h3>Reality</h3>
<p>It's easy to draw the line between what is mobile and desktop right now, but in the future that might not be so simple. Apple is pushing the iPad and keyboard dock as a viable laptop alternative with custom tablet software. Meanwhile, Google has the Pixel C, Chrome OS, and Android apps running in
the Android Runtime for Chrome. Nvidia has even made desktop gaming work on its Shield devices via GeForce Now.</p>

<u><h2>Apple Designing Its Own Servers to Keep Goverment Out</h2></u></div>

<img class=pictureone src=Applelogo.png alt="computer usage" style="width:423px;height:250px;">
<div style="font-size:15px" align=left class=para>
    <p>We've known for roughly two years the US government has programs devoted to intercepting computer hardware mid-shipment. These programs are used to insert backdoors or spyware deep into a system's firmware before it even arrives at its destination. A new report claims Apple is looking into building
    its own servers as a way to thwart this type of insertion.</p>
    <h3>Reason Behind It</h3>
    <p>Security isn't Apple's only motivation, the company has expressed unhappiness with Amazon Web Services and, according to VentureBeat, is working on a plan to build its own in-house data centers and software to run them. Currently, services like iTunes are mostly outsourced to other providers like Amazon 
    or Microsoft's competing Azure. Apple is far from the first company to take steps like this; Google publicly announced it would begin encrypting all data that travels through its data centers after information leaked that the NSA had tapped undersea cables to spy on Google's data centers from the inside, where 
    data was once unencrypted.</p>
