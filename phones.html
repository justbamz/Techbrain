<u><h2>MotoX Gets Leaked</h2></u></div>

    <p>In the first of the recent Moto X leaks, we saw a device that looked very different than 
    the last few Motorola flagships. The back panel was completely flat and made of metal, rather than the curved plastic, 
    wood, and leather of current phones. The trademark Motorola dimple was also gone, much to my personal dismay. That small
    depression serves as an excellent place for your finger thanks to the ergonomics of "internal stabilization." That's a big help with hand-stretching phablets.</p>
    
<h3>New Features</h3>
<img class=pictureone src=16contacts.png alt="New Feature" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
<p>On the bottom of this rear panel we see 16 electrical contacts, and sources now say these are for connecting modular accessories called Amps. If that sounds familiar, 
that's because Motorola isn't the only OEM to have this idea in 2016. LG did something similar with the G5. On that phone, the bottom of the phone comes completely off and can 
be replaced with a camera grip or Hi-Fi audio module. However, you need to shut the phone off, swap the battery, and wait for it to boot back up to swap G5 modules. Those two modules 
aren't even very compelling (and the Hi-Fi isn't available in the US). Motorola's system has the potential to be much more friendly.</p>

<p>According to the leaks, there will be six different attachments for the new Moto X, including a simple stylized cover that comes with the phone, a dedicated camera module with optical 
zoom, a pico projector, a battery pack, stereo speakers, and a wide-angle camera lens with rugged case. You’ll be able to simply snap these on the rear of the device without a full reboot.
The Amps will snap onto the back of the phone, going all the way from top to bottom. They’ll probably be held in place with magnets.</p>
<h3>Pricing</h3>
<p>Pricing will be key. LG wants $70 for the camera grip and nearly $200 for the Hi-Fi. I have a hard time believing people are going to buy very many $100-200 accessories for their phone.</p>

<u><h2>HTC 10 Vs. Samsung S7</h2></u></div>
<img class=pictureone src=htcs7.jpg alt="MOTO X LEAKS" style="width:423px;height:250px;">
<div style="font-size:15px" align=left class=para>
    <p>The last few years have been rough for HTC, with several flagship phone launches that didn't go as well as the company expected. At the same time, Samsung was reinventing its industrial
    design and implementing new screen technology. This year might be HTC's last chance to show it still has something to offer in the top-tier smartphone market, and it's making the argument with 
    the HTC 10. This all-aluminum slab has very similar internals to the Samsung Galaxy S7, but they don't have much in common beyond that. Let's see how these two devices stack up.</p>
    <h3>Specs</h3>
    <p>These are both Android phones running Marshmallow 6.0.1, but each has a customized skin on top. Samsungs TouchWiz skin used to (rightly) earn it the scorn of users, but it’s worked to make it
    a more agreeable experience in recent years. The version of Android on the GS7 has a more modern theme and there are some useful extras built-in like ultra power saver, configurable notification toggles, 
    and an always-on display.</p>
    
    <h3>Cameras</h3>
    <p>The Galaxy S7's camera remains on top of the heap as far as I can tell. It’s faster, takes better photos in low light, and the autofocus is faster. The photos from this phone are more likely to be good 
    the first time, whereas with the HTC 10 you’ll probably end up taking a few to make sure you get one you like. Samsung isn’t using a laser sensor for focus, but it licensed some neat Canon tech that lets all 
    the pixels on the sensor contribute to acquiring focus. It’s crazy-fast.</p>
    
    <h3>Display</h3>
    <img class=pictureone src=htcdisplay.jpg alt="HTC Dsiplay" style="width:300px;height:200px;">
    <p>I don't think that anyone would look at the HTC 10 and think the panel looks bad, but its not as good as the Samsung Galaxy S7ss. Looking at them side-by-side makes that clear. I don't know how often 
    you're going to do that, so maybe a few display foibles aren't a big deal.</p>
